My last post was already a few days ago, which is because I am now in the business phase.
This and next week I am in the department Service&Complaints, so I have a lot of contact with the holidaymakers.
I was allowed to work in the team from the beginning and therefore have a little less time for technical topics like TDD or Refactoring.

So far I have to say that the first days in the business phase were a really great experience with lots of interesting topics:
I got to know new colleagues, new programs and tools, and also got first impressions of the issues and desires the Urlaubers have to our platform.

So the business phase has started very nicely so far! :-)
