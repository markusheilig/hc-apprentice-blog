Yesterday and today I watched Kent Beck's video session [Test Driven Development](https://pragprog.com/screencast/v-kbtdd/test-driven-development).
I have to say that I was a bit confused by the way Beck demonstrates TDD in this screencast because I expected it to be something else.
What I missed the most were the baby steps, which I got to know so far from the TDD approach.
For me, it sometimes seemed that many assumptions were made and a lot of code was written at once.


After I finished the video session, I started to read his book *Test Driven Development by Example*.
Compared to his videos, in his book Beck really does the baby steps I've missed before.
In his book he writes:
>> Do these steps seem to small to you? Remember, TDD is not about taking teeny-tiny steps, it's about **being able to** take teeny-tiny steps.
   Would I code day-to-day with steps this small? No. But when things get the least bit weird, I'm glad I can.

Well, that explanation sounds pretty reasonable to me.
For me, however, it means continuing to stick to the baby steps first :-)

See you tomorrow!

Cheers!
