Last weekend, my colleagues Robert, Jan, Lewis and I have been at the SoCraTes2019 in Soltau.
The SoCraTes (abbreviation for Software Craft and Testing) is a 4-day conference (or rather unconference) for and by developers. 

But instead of writing all my impressions down in this post (I don't think I'd be finished with that), I'll just link to the presentation which Lewis and I gave to our IT colleagues last Friday :-)
