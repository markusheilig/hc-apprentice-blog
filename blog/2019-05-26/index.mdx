Today I had a refactoring session with my mentor [Wolfram â‰²Refactorerâ‰³ Kriesing](https://twitter.com/wolframkriesing) ðŸ˜Ž

What is refactoring?
[Uncle Bob](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2013/05/27/TheTransformationPriorityPremise.html) defines refactoring as 
> â€¦ simple operations that change the structure of code without changing its behavior.

Here is my collection of refactoring tips:

- Make sure that all tests pass before you start (otherwise you cannot ensure that your refactoring does not change behavior)
- If there are no tests for the code you want to refactor, write them before!
- When you write these tests, use code coverage tools to ensure that your test really tests the lines of code you are going to refactor
- Refactoring is done in small steps
- Make use of your IDE's built-in refactoring support
- Learn the IDE shortcuts for these refactoring tasks
- Create a shortcut in your IDE to run tests (this way you get feedback as quickly as possible)
- Run your tests as often as possible
- Try to stay green the whole time
- Don't hesitate to undo changes when you have a red bar
- Be aware that you are doing refactoring, not implementing new behavior
- Do not mix refactoring and behavioral changes in the same commit
- Refactoring is done for economic reasons, not because of code ethics
