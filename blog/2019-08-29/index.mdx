... since my last blog post. What was going on?

There were a lot of things in the last time going on, for example, I
- finished my time in my last business phase station
- started my Masterpiece project
- supported to set up a (company internal) testing guild
- just came back from SoCrates in Soltau, Germany
- ...

Is that an excuse? No, it's more the reasons why I let blogging slide.
However, there would be so much to report (just see the list above).
I think it's time to set my focus and thus I will report more about my upcoming (and also last) weeks as Apprentice.
Even though this is just a short blog post, it was time to write again.
But for now it's time to prepare the presentation Lewis and I will hold tomorrow about the SoCraTes for our IT colleagues.

I will also share my experiences about the SoCraTes in a blog post soon.

Cheers!
