Do you remember my post from [Day4&Day5](https://markusheilig.netlify.com/day-4-day-5), when I was looking for new ways to organize myself better?
Today I'll report which approaches I tried to keep focus on a task and how it worked so far.

**1. Manage my tasks on a piece of paper**

In addition to my Github-Projects board, I write down today's tasks on a piece of paper every morning.
I then try to work on these tasks in order from top to bottom.
After I have finished a task, I tick it off or cross it out.
Not only does this bring a little feeling of success every time, but it also shows me what's next.

**2. Disable notifications for a specific period of time**

I use the integrated "don't disturb" function on my Macbook to do this.
I noticed that this helps me to focus on the current task much better.
It is also sufficient to read mails and messages a bit later.

**3. Do not accept every invitation**

When I'm in a new environment, I always try to collect as many impressions and information as possible to understand current topics as well as their their connections.  
However, it is worth considering which events/talks are worth participating in, and when one might better take care of one's own tasks.
Really not that easy!

**4. Leave the office and find a quieter place if it gets too loud**

Sometimes when it gets too loud in the office, I just grab my laptop and look for a quieter place.
There are so many places nice places (also with a great view üèîüåä) here at the office. 

<br /> 
And now it's time to tick off the current task "write blog post" ‚úÖ
and search a cool kata for tomorrow's coding session üòé

Cheers!
