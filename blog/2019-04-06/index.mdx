As already announced in the last blog post, today I mainly took care finding a way to visualize my progress for the indiviual learning categories.
Uğurcan, one of the first Apprentices of HolidayCheck, has dealt with this problem a long time ago and decided to create his own solution.
Therefore, he developed a [Data Visualization Tool](https://github.com/SengitU/trello-data-visualization) for Trello boards using React.js & JavaScript.
This web app groups completed tasks according to their categories and plots the result afterward.
Actually this is what I'm looking for, with the only difference that Uğurcan used Trello for task management instead of Github-Projects (as I do).
I think it's great that Uğurcan once dealt himself with the topic 'self-organization & task-management' and therefore I decided to reuse his solution and extend it
by developing an integration for Github-Projects. Plus, I wanted to get a little insight into React.js ;-)

The idea behind this is simple:
 - Step 1: Use the Github REST-API to fetch project information from by task board.
 - Step 2: Convert the retrieved information into the same data model as the trello data model.
 - Step 3: Add an option to 'switch' between a Trello board and a Github-Projects board.
 
That's it, for the rest it should be possible to reuse Uğurcan's app.
Today I have implemented step 1 and step 2, step 3 will be done tomorrow :-)
