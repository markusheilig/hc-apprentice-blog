I chose J.B. Rainsberger's talk [Integrated Tests Are A Scam](https://vimeo.com/80533536) as my main topic for the last two days.
In his talk, JBrains explains the concepts of Integrated Tests, Isolated Tests and explains why Integrated Tests are a Scam.
This post describes what I learned from the talk.

#### What is an Integrated Test?

At the beginning of his talk, JBrains defines integrated tests as follows:

>> An integrated test is any test where the success or failure, pass or fail result, red or green, depends on many different bits of interesting behavior at once.

This means that for a failing integrated test, you cannot directly point to where the problem comes from.
Good tests have exactly the opposite property, i.e. we know exactly where the problem is when it fails.

#### What is an Isolated Test?

An isolated test is a test which tests an isolated part of the system, for example, a single function.
For me, this means that isolated tests are the opposite of integrated test.
When an isolated test fails, we know exactly what's going on and which part of the code caused the problem.
This is for the reason that "isolated tests put tremendous pressure on the design".

#### Integrated Tests vs Isolated Tests

In some situations, it is hard to write good, isolated tests.
This is mostly the case when we have several objects or (external) modules which interact with each other in a non-obvious way.
The kind of tests we then write to "test" our software is exactly these integrated tests.
Why is that?
Integrated tests are more somehow a workaround solution caused by a bad design. We then use this kind of test to fill the missing gaps.
Integrated tests, in contrast to isolated tests, allows us to take less care of the design, which we surely don't want!

#### So what's the Scam?

Imagine that 100% of our tests pass but we still find a mistake.
We fix the mistake and write an integrated test to be sure that the fix works.
We write an integrated test because the system's design makes it hard for us to write isolated tests.
We know that integrated tests allow us to design more sloppily, which then results in a higher chance for new mistakes.
Spending time on fixing a mistake and writing an integrated test means that we have less time for isolated tests.
It may also be too hard to write an isolated test as the design of our software may already be broken.
Afterward, we have 100% passing tests which sounds quite nice at first.
However, this is not true if much of our tests are integrated tests.
It's the opposite case!
Integrated tests support us in continuing a sloppy design and thus further increase the potential for new mistakes.
And this goes on and on and on ...
This is what JBrains calls "a positive feedback loop of negative feelings".


In my next blog post, I'll explain to you how I apply the concepts of isolated testing in a Tic-Tac-Toe game I wrote a few months ago.
See you on my next post :-)
