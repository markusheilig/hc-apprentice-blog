In today's blog post I'll tell you what I've learned so far about Elixir's pattern matching concepts
and which parts are really amazing in my opinion.
But first let me tell you a little secret: Elixir has no assignment operator ü§Øü§´

The first time I got in touch with Pattern Matching was with Scala.
At first I thought pattern matching is a slightly better version of the `switch` statement I knew from other languages like Java.
It took me some time to understand why pattern matching is much more powerful.
I think I just got the point when I saw a roman numerals converter in Scala implemented using pattern matching.

##### Pattern Matching in Elixir - The good parts
In Elixir, the `=` operator (which looks like an assignment operator) actually is a match operator which tries to match the right side to the left side.
For example, `x = 5` represents a successfull match and thus `x` is bound to 5.
In case a pattern match does not succeed, Elixir throws a `MatchError`.
Here are some examples:
````
x = 5             # pattern match works fine, so x is bound to 5
5 = x             # also fine, since x is bound to 5
^x = 5            # also fine, checks if 'x' is bound to 5, x will not be rebound
42 = x            # MatchError since the right hand side value 5 does not match to 42
{x, y} = {21, 42} # works fine, x is bound to 21, y is bound to 42
{x, x} = {42, 42} # works also fine, x is bound to 42
{x, x} = {21, 42} # MatchError since we expected the tuple elements to be the same
````

Pattern matching however cannot only be used for value checks, but also for destructuring complex data types like tuples, lists or maps.
Imagine we have a function `print_point` which accepts an argument called `point` and we want to print some information based on the `point`'s structure <u>and</u> data.
This could be done as follows:
````
def print_point(point) do
  case point do
      {x, x}    -> IO.puts("Point is in 2D space. X and Y are the same!")
      {x, y}    -> IO.puts("Point is in 2D space. X and Y are different!")
      {x, y, z} -> IO.puts("Point is in 3D space.")
      _         -> IO.puts("This is not a valid point in 2D/3D space!")
  end
end
````

##### Pattern Matching in Elixir - The great parts
Instead of pattern matching an argument within a function's body, Elixir allows us to define a function multiple times with different argument patterns.
Each of these definitions is called a *function clause*.
At runtime, Elixir checks for the corresponding clause (which is the one that first machtes the pattern in top down order) and then executes it.
Function clauses allow us to split our `print_point` function from above into four smaller functions, with each implementing their own logic:
````
def print_point({x, x}) do
  IO.puts("Point is in 2D space. X and Y are the same!")
end

def print_point({x, y}) do
  IO.puts("Point is in 2D space. X and Y are different!")
end

def print_point({x, y, z}) do
  IO.puts("Point is in 3D space.")
end

def print_point(point) do:
  IO.puts("#{point} is not a valid point in 2D/3D space!")
end
````

Function clauses are really amazing for so much reasons:

  1. Function clauses allow us to stay very close to known notations like mathematics.
     For example let's have a look at the mathematical definition of the Fibonacci sequence:

    `fib(0) = 0`<pre></pre>`fib(1) = 1`<pre></pre>`fib(n) = fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)`
    
    Function clauses help us to create code which is almost 100% identical to the original definition:    
    
    ```
    def fib(0), do: 0
    def fib(1), do: 1
    def fib(n), do: fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)
    ```

  2. We can use arguments from the clause in combination with function guards.
     Guards are additional checks which have to be fullfilled in order that a function clause matches.
     For example, we can create a guard which ensures that we can call our `fib` function with positive numbers only:
    ```` 
    def fib(n) when n > 0, do: ...
    ````

  3. Function clauses can save us from creating too large functions with too much control flow logic.
     I think this can have real impact on the code quality with respect to readability and maintainability:
     rather than inflating an existing function further, a developer might be more inclined to add a new clause instead.
     



So folks, that's it from me for this week.
I wish you happy Easter & lots of sun. üê∞ü•öüç≥üòé
