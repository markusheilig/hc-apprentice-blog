These days I setup a CI-Server using Jenkins and Docker.
I decided to go with Docker since I didn't want to 'pollute' my local machine further ðŸ˜….
Another reason for using Docker is that the setup is easier to understand once (once it is done) because everything is managed in its own environment.

I have to admit that I still don't know much about Docker and therefore I always spend a lot of time for googling the commands I need.
For that reason, let's use today's post to summarize the commands I use the most:

1. `docker build -t my-image .`
  Create an image from a Dockerfile.

1. `docker images`
  Show all images.

1. `docker run --name my-container my-image`
  Derive container from an image, name and run it.

1. `docker run --name my-container -p 8080:8080 my-image`
  Run a container and publish port 8080 to the host machine.

1. `docker ps`
  List all running containers.

1. `docker ps -a`
  List all containers.

1. `docker stop my-container`
  Stop a container ðŸ™ƒ

1. `docker exec -i -t my-container /bin/sh`
  Connect to container 'my-container' and run a shell.

BTW: This post could have been online for at least half an hour, but unfortunately I broke my Node.js version in an update today, so the blog can't be built anymore.
Maybe I should also run my blog with docker containers? ðŸ¤”

See you tomorrow!
