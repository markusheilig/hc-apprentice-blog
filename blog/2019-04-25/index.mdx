In yesterday's post I presented a simple Elixir implementation for a `Stack` process.
Today I had a talk with one of my mentors where I got asked how I know which
type of messages a process supports or how to find this out in an easy way (i.e. without looking in the pattern matching code in the `receive` part).

Good question because passing different kinds of messages like `:atoms`, `{tuples, ...}`, `"binaries"` and so on
surely is not the best solution.
When you use a statically typed language like Scala, you could define a class or object for each message type, e.g.:

`````scala
sealed trait StackMessage

case class  Push(elem: Any) extends StackMessage
case object Pop             extends StackMessage
case object Clear           extends StackMessage
`````

In my stack implementation from yesterday, it is not quite obvious which messages are supported and how their structure looks like.
For this reason, the Elixir/Erlang way for dealing with this is as follows:

We define a function for each operation we want to support and pass a reference to a stack process (that is a process id or 'PID') as well as the corresponding parameters for the operation to it.
For example, we create a function called `push` which accepts the stack-pid as a first and the element to be pushed as a second argument.
Within this `push` function, we send a message the the given stack process which allows us to hide the message structure from our clients:

``````
defmodule Stack do
    
  # public functions 

  def push(stack_pid, elem) do
    send(stack_pid, {:push, elem})
  end

  def clear(stack) do
    send(stack, :clear)
  end

  ...

  def loop(elements) do
    receive do
      {:push, elem} ->
        # handle push ...

      :clear        ->
        # handle clear ...

      # handle more messages ...
  end

end
``````

This approach has two major advantages compared to the solution from yesterday:

1. By defining a new function for each operation, we can benefit from our editor's auto-completion feature :-)
2. By hiding the message structure from others, it is much easier for us to change the code which is a really a win with respect to maintainance.

So much from me today, see you tomorrow!
