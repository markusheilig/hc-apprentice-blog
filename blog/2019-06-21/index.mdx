In the [first post](https://markusheilig.netlify.com/option-vs-either-part-1) of this trilogy, I introduced Scala's `Option` type and why I prefer it over `null`.
This post is all about another Scala monad called `Either`.

##### Motivation

Let's build a little wheel of Fortune application for a game show to determine a player's prize, which is either a carüöó or a goatüêê.
The chance for a player to win a brand new car is 33% (lucky guy!), whereas there is a chance of 67% that the player returns home with a new pet (sorry, bad luck!).

We assume, for whatever reasons, that the car and the goat have no common superclass or interface.
So for now we have two classes which represent the prizes:
``````
case class Car(color: String)
case class Goat(name: String)
``````

Now let's create a function which determines the prize for a player, called `determinePrize`.
Since a player can only win one of both prizes, we have to choose a return type which is able to handle both cases.
Reminder: our classes `Car` and `Goat` have no common superclass.
So what return type do we expect from our function?
Should we go for `Any` class, which is the superclass of all other classes (similar to `Object` in Java)?
While `Any` as return type would be technically ok, I don't like this approach very much since a caller really doesn't know what to expect from the function's result.
(Of course, we could use `Any` as return type and add a comment that the function will return a car object or a goat object, but comments are outdated quickly because they are often not updated when the code changes.)

##### The Either Type

As I already mentioned above, a player can only win one of both prizes, that is *either* a car *or* a goat.
Scala's standard library defines a trait called `Either[A, B]` with the type arguments, `A` and `B`.
There are exactly two subclasses of `Either`, called `Left[A]` and `Right[B]`.
So an object can be either of type `Left` and contain a value of type `A`, or of type `B` and contain a value of type `B`.
So lets use `Either[A, B]` as return type for our function `determinePrize`, using `Goat` for type parameter `A` and `Car` for type parameter `B`, i.e. `Either[Goat, Car]`.

````scala
def determinePrize(wheelOfFortuneResult: Double): Either[Goat, Car] = {
  val chanceToWinTheCar = 0.33
  if (wheelOfFortuneResult <= chanceToWinTheCar)
    Right(Car("Red"))
  else
    Left(Goat("Pitu"))
}
````

Let's write some tests to see how it works in practice:

````scala
"Prize for Wheel of Fortune" should "be a car" in {
  val prize = determinePrize(wheelOfFortune = 0.25)
  prize.isLeft shouldBe false
  prize.isRight shouldBe true
  prize.right.get shouldBe Car("Red")
}

it should "be a goat in" in {
  val prize = determinePrize(wheelOfFortune = 0.8)
  prize.isLeft shouldBe true
  prize.isRight shouldBe false
  prize.left.get shouldBe Goat("Pitu")
}

it should "be possible to pattern match the prize" in {
  val wheelOfFortune = generateRandomDoubleBetween(0, 1)
  val prize = determinePrize(wheelOfFortune)
  prize match {
    case Left(Goat(name)) => println(s"Your goat is called $name")
    case Right(Car(color)) => println(s"Your car is $color")
  }
}
````


**Note:** `Either` is not the same as a tuple! While a tuple is an element containing two values at a time, an instance of `Either` is either `Left[A]` or `Right[B]` and thus contains only a single value of the specified type.

In the third blog post of this trilogy, I'll explain why Lewis and I decided for a refactoring from `Option` to `Either`.
P.S.: If you ever take part in a Wheel of Fortune, don't be sad if you win the üêê - it gives excellent milkü•õ and cheeseüßÄ!
