Currently, I'm reading the 3rd chapter of Martin Fowler's book *Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code*.
So far, I like the book and the examples Martin Fowler provides. However, sometimes, it is hard to follow because he uses a lot of cross-references for different refactoring techniques.
This results in a lot of jumps and therefore interrupts the reading flow.
At least, I'm happy that I have the Amazon-Kindle version instead of the printed one!

In this post, I'll describe some refactoring techniques (**RT**), which I don't consider evident by their name (and thus I looked up again and again).
Writing things down is a good way for me to remember them, but since there are **a lot** of refactoring techniques, I will update this blog post from time to time.
So let's start:

**RT 189 - Hide Delegate** ...

... to achieve encapsulation by avoiding accessing nested objects.

For example, instead of 
```JavaScript
const manager = employee.department.manager;
```

better write
```JavaScript
const manager = employee.manager;
class Employee {
    get manager() { return this.department.manager; }
}
```

**RT 231 - Replace Loop with Pipeline** ...

... because declarative functions may be easier to follow than imperative code.

Instead of 
```JavaScript
const names = [];
for (const person of persons) {
    if (person.job === 'programmer')
        names.push(person.name);    
}
```

write
```JavaScript
const names = persons
                .filter(p => p.job === 'programmer')
                .map(p => p.name);
```

**RT 362 - Replace Type Code with Subclasses** ...

... to split up a large class with too much responsibility into several subclasses.

Before
```JavaScript
const createNewEmployee = (name, employeeType) => {
    return new Employee(name, type);
}
```

After
```JavaScript
const createNewEmployee = (name, employeeType) => {
    switch(employeeType) {
        case 'engineer': return new Engineer(name);
        case 'salesman': return new Salesman(name);
        case 'manager': return new Manager(name);
    }    
}
```

**RT 380 - Collapse Hierarchy** ...

... when a subclass and its parent class are not different enough to be worth keeping separate.

---

**RT 399 - Replace Superclass with Delegate** ...

... to get rid of inheritance by using a 'has-a' relation instead of a 'is-a' relation.

This can be done by replacing
```JavaScript
class List {}
class Stack extends List {}
```

with
```JavaScript
class List {}
class Stack {
    constructor() {
        this.storage = new List()
    }
}
```

As described above, there are a lot of different refactoring techniques, so this post will grow over time :-)
